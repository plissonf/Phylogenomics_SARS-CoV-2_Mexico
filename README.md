# Phylogenomics_SARS-CoV-2_Mexico
Incidences, covariances and positions of 315 mutations of concern (MOC) in 1552 viral sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (pre-vaccination period: late 2019-February 2021).

Python script
- Heatmaps: incidences (relative frequencies) of 315 (and most frequent) MOCs across 1552 viral genome sequences grouped in different clades/lineages/
- Correlograms: multicollinearity and covariances between MOCs

R script
- Chord diagrams: Covariances (co-occurences) between MOCs

PyMOL session
- 3D structural representation of glycoprotein Spike (S) of SARS-CoV-2 bound to one ACE2.
